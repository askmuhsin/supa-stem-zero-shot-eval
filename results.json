If the air resistance and friction are 450 N and 200 N respectively, calculate the thrust produced by the car engine.\nChoices:\n    A: 650 N\n    B: 1125 N\n    C: 1775 N\n    D: 1945 N\n\nSolution:  ",

      "model_response": "To calculate the thrust produced by the car engine, we need to consider the forces acting on the car. The net force required to accelerate the car is given by Newton's second law:\n\n\\[\nF_{\\text{net}} = m \\cdot a\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( m = 750 \\, \\text{kg} \\) (mass of the car)\n- \\( a = 1.5 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\) (acceleration)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nF_{\\text{net}} = 750 \\, \\text{kg} \\times 1.5 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 = 1125 \\, \\text{N}\n\\]\n\nThe net force \\( F_{\\text{net}} \\) is the difference between the thrust produced by the engine \\( F_{\\text{thrust}} \\) and the opposing forces (air resistance and friction):\n\n\\[\nF_{\\text{net}} = F_{\\text{thrust}} - F_{\\text{air}} - F_{\\text{friction}}\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( F_{\\text{air}} = 450 \\, \\text{N} \\)\n- \\( F_{\\text{friction}} = 200 \\, \\text{N} \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n1125 \\, \\text{N} = F_{\\text{thrust}} - 450 \\, \\text{N} - 200 \\, \\text{N}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( F_{\\text{thrust}} \\):\n\n\\[\nF_{\\text{thrust}} = 1125 \\, \\text{N} + 450 \\, \\text{N} + 200 \\, \\text{N} = 1775 \\, \\text{N}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the thrust produced by the car engine is **1775 N**.\n\n**Answer: C: 1775 N**",
